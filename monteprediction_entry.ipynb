        "where $a$ is a system parameter set at approximately $a=300$. This is almost your score and approximately one week from now it will appear in the [weekly scoring](https://www.monteprediction.com/weekly). There is also an overall likelihood score although only available through the [api](https://www.monteprediction.com/api/scores) at time of writing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Accumulated wealth\n",
        "\n",
        "There is also an [overall wealth](https://www.monteprediction.com/) computed for each player based on their longitudinal performance. To see how your wealth is updated each week, let us suppose you have an initial wealth $W_i$.\n",
        "\n",
        "A system parameter $b_i=0.1$ determines the fraction of your total wealth you deploy that week. You are considered to invest $\\Omega_i = b_i W_i$ and similarly for other participants yielding a total investment of $\\Omega = \\sum_i \\Omega_i$. This pot will be split when the truth $z$ is revealed.\n",

        "To this end your 'mass' is $Q_i(z) = \\Omega_i \\rho_i(z)$ represents loosely how many of your samples are close to $z$ weighted by your wealth. The total mass near $z$ supplied by all participants is $Q(z) = \\sum_i Q_i(z)$. Your payout is $\\Omega \\frac{Q_i(z)}{Q(z)}$ which may be thought of as your share of the mass near the truth. Your net profit is $\\delta_i(z) = \\Omega \\frac{Q_i(z)}{Q(z)} - \\Omega_i$ and that is what dictates how your wealth ticks up or down from one week to the next.   \n",
        "\n",
        "### Incentive\n",
        "\n",
        "It should be apparent that $Q$ plays the role of an unnormalized market probability (i.e. risk-neutral density) and further, that a participant with perfect knowledge of the true density $P$ will at worst break even against any opponents' play, subject only to the ability to approximate $P$ with a collection of Monte Carlo paths in this fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "(Because this entry has been included in the mix, and is not particularly clever, there is a subsidy for participation for anyone taking even a moment to reflect statistically upon the problem ... for instance, by applying shrinkage to the covariance estimation or fixing the 1-margins).\n",

        "It is hoped that this will reward more accurate predictions with greater statistical power (i.e. more skill versus luck).
